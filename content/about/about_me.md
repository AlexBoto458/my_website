My name is Alexandru-Victor Botorog and I am currently undertaking a Masters in Analytics and Management at **London Business School** (LBS). Before LBS, I pursued a BSc in Economics at **University College London** (UCL) and graduated in the summer of 2022 with a [First Class Honours degree](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1G-9Jsd779jrsFfhTX7nIn4ciRa3OmiWb/view?usp=sharing) and an average mark of 77. Due to my outstanding performance in the BSc in Economics programme, I have been included in the [Dean's List 2022](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11qTCM9DK7WmqhfJJLYXDlDBcm3G_c0N6/view?usp=sharing), a distinction awarded to the top 5% of UCL Economics graduates. 

I am a very capable problem solver with outstanding numerical and analytical skills. I have been refining these skills consistently over the years through rigorous preparation in fields such as mathematics and physics during high school, or economics, statistics, and programming at university. I owe most of my skill development during high school to my participation and training for olympiads and other competitions in mathematics or physics. Throughout those years, I have won numerous county and national level awards, having qualified for 5 consecutive years (2014-2018) to the National Physics Olympiad and having won two bronze medals (2015, 2017). In the final high school examination, the Romanian Baccalaureate, I obtained the following marks:

-   10 in Mathematics
-   10 in Physics
-   9.8 in Romanian Language and Literature

Due to my natural aptitude for quantitative subjects and my interest in social, political, and business issues, I decided that economics would be the perfect subject to study as an undergraduate. The training I have received in economics taught me how to approach and solve real-world problems that might be encountered in business or public policy contexts. My passion for problem solving and corporate affairs eventually led to me applying for and pursuing an internship at Roland Berger's Bucharest office during the summer of 2021. At UCL, I have also developed a strong interest in statistics, programming, and data science, and how these can be used to solve the overly complex business and finance issues that companies face nowadays. I am now pursuing the MAM at LBS to fully establish my expertise in this area and have the chance to apply it in the future in an industry I am passionate about, such as strategy consulting, investment management, or fintech.

My hobbies include going to the gym, playing sports (basketball, volleyball, tennis), hiking, going to music festivals, and reading fiction.
