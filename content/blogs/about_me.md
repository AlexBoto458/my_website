My name is Alexandru-Victor Botorog and I am currently undertaking a Masters in Analytics and Management at London Business School (LBS). Before LBS, I pursued a BSc in Economics at University College London (UCL) and graduated in the summer of 2022 with a [First Class Honours degree](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1G-9Jsd779jrsFfhTX7nIn4ciRa3OmiWb/view?usp=sharing) and an average mark of 77. Due to my outstanding performance in the BSc in Economics programme, I have been included in the [Dean's List 2022](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11qTCM9DK7WmqhfJJLYXDlDBcm3G_c0N6/view?usp=sharing), a distinction awarded to the top 5% of Economics graduates.

I am a very capable problem solver with outstanding numerical and analytical skills. I have been consistently refining these skills over the years through rigorous preparation in fields such as mathematics and physics during high school, or economics, statistics, and programming at university. I owe most of my skill development during high school to my participation and training for olympiads and other competitions in mathematics or physics. Throughout the years, I have won numerous county and national level awards, having qualified for 5 consecutive years (2014-2018) to the National Physics Olympiad and having won two bronze medals (2015, 2017). 

Due to my natural aptitude for quantitative subjects and my interest in social, political, and business issues, I decided that economics would be the perfect subject to study as an undergraduate. The training I have received in economics taught me how to approach and solve complex, real-world problems which might be encountered in business or public policy contexts. I have also developed a strong interest in statistics, programming, data science, and how these can used to solve business and finance problems. I am now pursuing the MAM at LBS to fully establish my expertise in this area and have the chance to apply it in the future in an industry I am passionate about, such as management consulting, investment management, or fintech.

My hobbies include going to the gym, playing sports (basketball, volleyball, tennis), hiking, going to music festivals, or reading fiction.
